= Mosh (My Own Hash With Methods)
 
http://github.com/dlt/mosh
 
== DESCRIPTION:
 
Mosh is my own version of mash (http://github.com/mbleigh/mash/).
I prefered to avoid method_missing and instead used instance_eval
for creating methods.
This library can be useful when you need to have hashes that look like
objects.
 
== SYNOPSIS:
  
  mosh = Mosh.new
  mosh['name'] = "Hello"
  mosh.name # => "Hello"
  
  #it recursively creates moshes from arrays and nested hashes/moshes
  nested = Mosh.new :a => [1, 2, 3], :b => {:c => 2}
  nested.a # => [1, 2, 3]
  nested.b.c # => 2
  
  #See more info at the specs diretory. 
== INSTALL:
